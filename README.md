# ML-Image-Classification


### The images where collected by Intel for image process
the images consist of six classes, images for:
- mountains
- streets
- glacier
- buildings
- sea
- forest

#### Goal of this project
Correctly classify an image within the 6 class without a label


### Importance of Image classification

Image Classification has been an import part of Machine Learning in recent times; mainly, because the world is experience a fast increase in automation and robotics, such as driveless cars, drones, and space rovers.

#### Perseverance Rover

The image above shows the recent rover sent to mars; inorder for this rover to move around they need eyes (camera) and a brain to process the information the camera feeds them. Image process is part of the brain of the rover; the computer can process an image through classification to determine if it rock or ice.

Also, same idea is applied in Telsa driveless cars. They use cameras and the images produce by the cameras are processed through machine learning.
